Using Apify for hyperloop data collection, Twitter tweets were preprocessed and analyzed, achieving a coherence score of 0.5488 with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Topic Modelling. A sentiment classifier revealed polarized opinions, with sarcasm detected in 2.1% of tweets and opinion inversion in 18.83% of tweet pairs. The Random Forest algorithm achieved 84.79% accuracy for opinion inversion prediction, highlighting the complexity of public sentiment on hyperloop technology.

This project analyzes market basket analysis using the Apriori, ECLAT, and FPGrowth algorithms, comparing their performance on retail transaction data to evaluate computational efficiency and the quality of generated association rules. The study highlights FPGrowth as the fastest algorithm and Apriori as producing the most comprehensive rules, offering insights into choosing suitable algorithms for market basket analysis.
